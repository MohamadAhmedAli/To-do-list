# To-Do List Application
This is a simple To-Do List Application built in C# that allows users to manage their tasks using a command-line interface. Tasks are stored in a text file for persistence, and users can add, view, mark as completed, or remove tasks.

Features
Add a task: Add a new task to the list.
View tasks: View all tasks currently in the list.
Mark a task as completed: Mark any task as completed.
Remove a task: Remove a specific task from the list.
Persistent storage: Tasks are saved to a tasks.txt file, so the list is preserved across sessions.
